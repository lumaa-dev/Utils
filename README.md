# Utils
Utils was probably my best Discord bot ever. And this is the last working version.

It was somewhat of [SlashBot](https://slashbot.de) but before it existed. With reaction roles, a Modal-maker that surely still works nowadays.\
Making this a totally different README file because this branch contains the last working version of Utils before "upgrading" it to a [database thing](https://github.com/lumaa-dev/Utils/tree/main). This is also why this branch is called `pre-db`, because this version doesn't use a database. It uses a JSON written in embeds' footers which was nice to not use a DB but was really disgusting visually.

# Utils
Utils was probably my best Discord bot ever. And this is the last working version.

This is a fully working version of Utils. Yeah. I fixed it all up.\
So this is SlashBot but before it actually got famous and all, and it was before the Onboarding feature. It has menu roles and a private ticket system using private threads.
